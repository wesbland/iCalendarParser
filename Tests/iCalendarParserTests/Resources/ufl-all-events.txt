SUMMARY:Short-Course: Cleanrooms & Gowning
DESCRIPTION:Course Description      Cleanrooms are controlled environment
 s in which airborne and surface-bound particles are limited based on the
 classification of the space. Maintaining particulate specifications requi
 res specific behaviors and protocols\, with the goal of maintaining regul
 atory compliance and ensuring a quality product.          This hands-on c
 ourse will cover best practices for working in a cleanroom\, including go
 wning and de-gowning (donning and doffing)\, proper entrance and exiting\
 , behaviors to minimize turbulence and the generation of particulates\, a
 nd multiple tips for reducing the likelihood of contamination. Topics dis
 cussed include architectural features common to cleanrooms\, types and cl
 assifications\, and an overview of cleaning and environmental monitoring
 procedures. Regulations from the International Organization for Standardi
 zation (https://www.iso.org/home.html) (ISO) and the United States Federa
 l Standards for the use of cleanrooms will be emphasized\, with examples
 of human health and financial consequences resulting from non-compliance.
       Learning Objectives      • Recall the International Organization
 for Standardization (ISO)\, its purpose\, and cleanroom classifications
     • Understand the purpose and influence of standards and regulations
  in clean manufacturing      • Diagram and discuss cleanroom design\, o
 perations\, and costs associated with contamination control      • Demo
